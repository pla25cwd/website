			best shits is (allegedly) a collection of (allegedly) music, (allegedly) from (allegedly) various (allegedly) sources.<br><br>
			Abraxas created the archangel John Timeisit (Temporal Aeon), banished after constructing Time, forfeiting all knowledge of it he possesed. He wanders an eternal emanation.<br>
			Ufo Friedbert, another producer of Best Shits, was born in Obergummerlsbachheimenberg, NRW, BRD in 1974, soon inventing the revolutionary Monetary-Techno-Schlager at the age of 7. He spawned the neo-reaganist "ShitHead" subculture of the 19270s, which lasted for 0.13 decades. Friedbert's relation to UFOs is disputed, most prominently by Ufo Friedbert himself, who spends ~300 pages of his 457 page biography arguing that he is not an alien.<br>
			various other artists and religious figures have contributed to the best shits collection, including the alphorn prodigy duo "geisse peter & huere buenzli" and former executive of saudi-aramco and second cousin thrice removed of Ufo Friedbert, Sheikh Al-Friedbert (creator of the controversial "what time is jihad", which greatly contributed to funding the afghan mujahideen). aswell as mr blobber. mr blobbers many crimes are unspoken.<br><br>
			shrek is also involved i think.<br><br>
			release dates &lt; ~2025 are very rough and dont look exactly right, derived from FL project files and file creation dates.<br><br>
			upon listening to any Best Shitâ„¢ you are legally obligated to send 100 ZWD to the following adress:<br>
			Gringpartei Pyramide,<br>
			555 Red Sea Crossing Hwy,<br>
			Golmud, Haixi Prefecture, Peoples Republic
