			best shits is (allegedly) a collection of (allegedly) music, from various sources, creation destined by the Archons.<br><br>
			Adonaios, creating the angel John Timeisit (Temporal Aeon), banished after creating Time, forfeiting all knowledge of it himself. He wanders an eternal emanation.<br>
			Ufo Friedbert, another producer of Best Shits, was born in Obergummerlsbachheimenberg, NRW, BRD in 1974, soon inventing the revolutionary Monetary-TechnoSchlager at the age of 7, the only music genre currently legal in Eritrea. He spawned the neo-monarcho-reaganist "Shithead" craze of the 19270s, which lasted for 0.13 decades. Friedbert's relation to Aliens and UFOs is disputed, most prominently by Ufo Friedbert himself, who spends ~300 pages of his 457 page biography arguing that he is not an alien, his parents simply hated him when he was born.<br>
			various other artists and religious figures have contributed to the best shits collection, including the alphorn prodigy duo "geisse peter & huere buenzli", former executive of saudi-aramco and second cousin thrice removed of Ufo Friedbert, Sheikh Al-Friedbert (creator of the controversial "what time is jihad", which greatly funded the afghan mujahideen), and mr blobber. do not mention mr blobber. <br><br>
			shrek is also involved i think.<br><br>
			release dates are probably all wrong and approxiguesstimated.<br><br>
			if you like any of these tracks you are legally obligated (upon reading this btw i asked my lawyers) to send 50 CHF to the following address:<br>
			Gringpartei Pyramide,<br>
			555 Red Sea Crossing Hwy,<br>
			Golmud, Haixi Prefecture, Peoples Republic
